# Committee Message

The motivation for this talk is to demystify blockchain-based development of distributed applications (dApps). I will do so through using my experience of implementing [Provenator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Provenator), a prototype application for proving the origins of captured digital media.

Provenator is the result of the academic paper: [Fake News - a Technological Approach to Proving Provenance Using Blockchains](https://doi.org/10.1089/big.2017.0071)
